#CG-Project

A game with two ships(pirate ships maybe) with canons and it is a two player game where both the players use keyboad to control the ships and fire canons at the opponent's ship and sink the ship. The  movement of the ships will be in a direction(vertical or horizontal). There will be a health bar or a damge meter. There will also be a leaderboards which displays the highest number of continuous wins of a person. Apart from ships there will be blue water with waves, blue sky with clouds. There is a menu where the player can choose to play or view leaderboards or exit. On clicking play the player will be asked to type the player name which we will be using to display in the leaderboards. That is all the player needs to do to start the game. An object(.obj) file of the ship which will contain all vertex and texture data using blender and parsing the data and storing it in vertex arrays and render the ship using the vertex arrays. There will also be mySQL libraries to store the highscores.
